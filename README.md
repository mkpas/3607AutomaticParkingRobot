# 3607AutomaticParkingRobot
Automatic Parking Robot

The following repository contains the code written for the major project for ELEC3607.

The project was to design a robot that could navigate lines and park automatically in a parking space using the assistance of infrared LEDs and phototransistors.

The code utilises an altered version of the open source Seeedstudio bluetooth module UART example code:
